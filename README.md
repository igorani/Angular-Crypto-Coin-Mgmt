# Angular-Template Application

Simple Angular application which covers all the Angular 2/4/5 concepts.

Ideal to be used as a foundation for your project.

It is created based on the Pluralsight course: ["Angular: Getting Started"](http://bit.ly/Angular-GettingStarted)


*** RUNNING THE APP ***

Just pull or download the project, open your preferred CLI, navigate to the project folder and run the commands: 
1. "nmp install"
2. "npm start" or "ng serve" to start the app

The app will start on localhost:4200 (if 4200 is the default port).

NOTE: The installation was tested using node v6.5.0 and npm 3.10.6.
